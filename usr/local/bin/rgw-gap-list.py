Version: 5.0

## Major version change log
v5: Now multi-threaded ( submit / process )
v4: Now storing results in RADOS
v3: Now using async io
v2: Now in Python, performing RADOS stat on the backing objects
v1: Initial shell script, has performance limitations due to long running
    listing processes.

Performs a Rados Gateway Gap analysis

Over the years, there have been a couple of bugs which resulted in backing
user data being deleted for Ceph RGW S3 objects.  It's rare, but has happend.

There is a shell script tool available ( that I also wrote ) but it has a few
drawbacks:
- It must wait for a complete `radosgw-admin bucket radoslist` to complete
- It must wait for a complete `rados ls` on the bucket data pool to complete
- Then it compares the listings looking for gaps in `rados ls`
- It's prone to false positives which can be tedious for mere mortals to
  verify.

-- This can take a LONG time on large clusters, and it doesn't generate any
   usable output until both lists are complete and the comparison begins.

This python version attempts to address these shortcoming in the following way:
1. It runs on a per-bucket basis and generates usable output for each bucket
   along the way.
2. When ran without any bucket constraints ( either bucket list, or list file ),
   this script maintains state synchronization using dedicated objects in the
   bucket index pool in the 'rgw-gap-list' namespace (by default).
3. Since the state is synchronized via Ceph RADOS... multiple instances can be
   running in parallel, even across different hosts!
4. This script can also be ran with the '-r' option to generate a report of
   current running hosts, and state per bucket.
5. This script can verify its own results by passing the '-x' flag.

Usage can be had by passing '--help' to the script.

## Tips:
- I recommend using '-vv' the first time ( or any time ) to see what is going
  on.
- Get a report of current host activity and bucket scan states by passing '-r'
- You can force a rescan by passing '-a #' with a value in seconds to consider
  the prior scan stale ( after the # seconds value ) - use 1 to force rescan
  everything.
- You can wipe out the synchronized state data by passing '-d'
- Passing any bucket constraints ( -b or -l ) ignores the synchronized state!!
  -- NOTE -- Read the above line again.
- The bucket data pool(s) and the sync state pool can be overridden with '-p'
  and '-s', respectively.
  -- NOTE -- If you don't use the same pools on all instances of this script,
  the synchronized state will not work.
- You can verify the RADOS stored results with the '-x' parameter.
- You can limit the objects to only those matching a given prefix using the
  '-m' parameter.
- The '-g', '-r' and '-x' parameters support json output by adding '-j' flag.

## Known Issues:
- If two separate instances attempt to start processing the same bucket in
  a very narrow window ( < 50ms, but the exact value depends on a lot of
  variables ), they may both succeed in starting the process, instead of one
  winning the race to push the sync object omap update and blocking the other.
  This has no real impact aside from doubling any gap objects listed in the
  results and having two threads processing the same bucket.

Enjoy!
